## Overview

OpenSSL-WASM-JS provides cryptographic functionality in web browsers through WebAssembly. While this enables powerful cryptographic operations directly in the browser, it also introduces specific security considerations that developers should be aware of.

## WebAssembly Security Model

WebAssembly runs in a sandboxed environment within the browser with the following security properties:

1. **Memory Isolation**: WebAssembly modules have their own linear memory that is not directly accessible from JavaScript without explicit exports.

2. **No Direct System Access**: WebAssembly code cannot directly access the file system, network, or other system resources.

3. **Same-Origin Policy**: WebAssembly modules are subject to the same-origin policy enforced by browsers.

4. **Deterministic Execution**: WebAssembly execution is deterministic, which helps prevent certain types of side-channel attacks.

However, WebAssembly is not immune to all security concerns:

1. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks may still be possible depending on the implementation.

2. **Memory Safety**: While WebAssembly provides memory isolation from the host, memory safety within the WebAssembly module depends on the compiled code.

## Cryptographic Considerations

### Random Number Generation

In a browser environment, secure random number generation is critical for cryptographic operations. OpenSSL-WASM-JS addresses this by:

1. Using the browser's cryptographically secure random number generator (`crypto.getRandomValues()`) when available.

2. Falling back to OpenSSL's RAND functions, which have been patched to work in the WebAssembly environment.

### Key Management

Browser environments present unique challenges for key management:

1. **Storage**: Private keys stored in browser storage (localStorage, IndexedDB) are vulnerable if the device is compromised.

2. **Memory Exposure**: Keys in memory might be exposed through browser memory dumps or if the page is cached.

3. **Cross-Origin Risks**: Ensure cryptographic operations are performed in a secure context to prevent cross-origin attacks.

## Browser Environment Limitations

The browser environment imposes several limitations on cryptographic operations:

1. **No Access to System Entropy Sources**: Unlike native OpenSSL, the WebAssembly version cannot access system entropy sources like `/dev/urandom`.

2. **Performance Constraints**: Cryptographic operations may be slower in WebAssembly compared to native code.

3. **Feature Limitations**: Some OpenSSL features that depend on system resources (like hardware acceleration) are not available.

## Best Practices

When using OpenSSL-WASM-JS in your applications:

### General Security

1. **Always Use HTTPS**: Ensure your application is served over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

2. **Content Security Policy**: Implement a strict Content Security Policy to prevent XSS attacks that could compromise cryptographic operations.

3. **Subresource Integrity**: Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) when loading the library from a CDN.

### Cryptographic Operations

1. **Key Generation**: Generate keys with sufficient entropy and appropriate key lengths.

2. **Secure Key Storage**: Consider using the Web Crypto API's `CryptoKey` objects with `non-extractable` set to `true` for sensitive keys.

3. **Ephemeral Keys**: Use ephemeral keys when possible and avoid storing private keys in browser storage.

4. **Salt and IV Management**: Always use unique salts and initialization vectors for each encryption operation.

### Code Examples

Secure key generation:

```javascript
// Generate a secure AES-256 key
const key = openssl.randomBytes(32);

// Use the key for encryption
const encrypted = openssl.aesEncrypt(data, key, iv);
```

Proper IV handling:

```javascript
// Generate a unique IV for each encryption
const iv = openssl.randomBytes(16);

// Store the IV with the ciphertext (it doesn't need to be secret)
const encrypted = openssl.aesEncrypt(data, key, iv);
const result = {
  iv: openssl.toHex(iv),
  ciphertext: openssl.toHex(encrypted)
};
```

## Known Limitations

OpenSSL-WASM-JS has the following security limitations:

1. **No Hardware Security Module Support**: Cannot interface with HSMs or secure enclaves.

2. **Limited Protection Against Side-Channel Attacks**: The WebAssembly environment may not fully protect against timing attacks or other side-channel vulnerabilities.

3. **Memory Management**: WebAssembly memory is subject to garbage collection by the browser, which may leave sensitive data in memory longer than necessary.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in OpenSSL-WASM-JS, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Please do not disclose the issue publicly until it has been addressed.

2. **Contact the Maintainers**: Send an email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with details of the vulnerability.

3. **Provide Details**: Include steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any suggested mitigations.

We take security issues seriously and will respond as quickly as possible.
